# Can-You-See--NN-It-BREAST-CANCER-IMAGE-CHARACTERIZATION-UTILIZING-CUSTOMIZED-GOOGLENET-CNN
Our group aims to characterize breast cancer tissue in image inputs by utilizing deep learning techniques, a form of machine learning. Specifically, we are using a CNN, or convolutional neural network. We hope to create a program that will automatically identify if an Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) tumor is present in images, providing an output decision that notifies the user whether a tumor is present in the histopathology image. This link includes the project script as a .mlx file, the original CNN network modified from GoogLe Net (original_network.mat), the final training network (T-CNNnew.mat), the data set (paultimothymooney.m), the training output data structure (trained_CNN 3050k.mat), and visualizations of the outputs (cmatrix3050k.PNG, confusionmatrix.png, training_CNN.png, and trainingCNN3050kimage.PNG). We hope to quickly and accurately delineate images into IDC+ and IDC- classes by utilizing the CNN. 
Running the code: Please follow all instructions in the final project document and spotlight video. If these instructions aren't followed a pathing error will occur and the code will not run. 
Hardware Requirements: We recommend that users of these assets have a GPU to process the code as CNNs are resource intensive and you may experiences lagging or delays otherwise.
